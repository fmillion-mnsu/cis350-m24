# Individual Assignment 2

**Due Date: May 28th, 2024 at 11:59 PM**

For this assignment you will create a form of educational material to inform and guide an average person on what a given attack is and how to protect themselves against it.

## Topics

Choose among the following specific risks/attacks for this project:

* Phishing (via E-mail, social media, etc.)
* Scams that result in financial loss and/or data compromise (either phone-based or Internet-based - your choice)
* Ransomware
* Large data breaches
* Password re-use across many services/sites

If you have another type of attack you want to cover, please contact me. Note that the target audience for your project is individuals who are not technically savvy and who are not working in cybersecurity or technical roles, so certain types of attacks may not apply (example: poor network isolation).

## Format

You may choose any medium you like for this project. Any of the following are acceptable:

* an advisory document that you might send via E-mail, or suitable for printing out
* a pamphlet that someone could print out and distribute
* a digital pamphlet with some interactivity
* a video presentation
* a "podcast episode style" audio presentation
* any other creative medium you feel comfortable producing

## Content

Your product must include all of the following content in whatever strategy is appropriate for your chosen medium:

* What the attack is and how it works at a non-technical level
* The potential consequences of being a victim of the attack
* At least two examples of where your attack occurred in the real, and the outcomes if you can find them (not all public disclosures will reveal the actual outcome/resolution)
* Solid, informed advice for individuals on how to protect themselves from the attack. (Do some research for this!)

There is no specified size, length, etc. for this project - you only need ensure that you have fully covered the above four points.

Minimize use of technical jargon, or if you must use a technical term, define it within your content in a way that would be understood by a person who is not technically savvy. 

## Deliverable

Prepare your submission in a format of your choice as described above and submit either the product itself, or a working link to it, to the D2L Dropbox. 

Note that for "printed" materials, you do not actually have to "print" the material. The best option would be to create a PDF document - both Windows and Mac have built-in ways to generate a PDF of a document from anything that can print, and this PDF would be a suitable submission.

For large submissions like videos or audio files you may use your MNSU OneDrive account and create a link that is accessible for viewing by "anyone with the link", and post that link into the D2L dropbox. You may also use another solution such as YouTube, a personal DropBox, etc. but **you must leave the media available until at least June 7th, 2024**.

This is an **individual** assignment. All class members must submit an original, independently created submission.

## Scoring Rubric

This assignment is worth 100 points. Points are assigned as follows:

| Item | Points | Penalties |
|-|-|-|
| Provided detailed information on a specific cybersecurity attack | 30 | Variable point loss if significant or important details are missing. |
| Provided at least two real-life examples of the attack, and explained the potential or real consequences of the attack | 25 | 10 points lost for each real-life example missing. |
| Provided appropriate strategies for mitigation of the attack that can be exercised by non-technical users. | 30 | Variable point loss if poor/incorrect advice given or advice is missing. |
| Good overall presentation of material in your chosen format | 15 | Variable point loss if content is difficult to follow, understand, or is extremely poorly designed. |

Late submissions will receive a total loss of percentage of earned points based on the syllabus's Late Work policy. **Submissions 3 days late or later will receive 0 points.**
